# typescript-utilities-guide

a list of typescript helper libraries. advanced guides in `typescript-cheatsheets` will assume knowledge of these and refer people here.

There is a stage in every TypeScript journey where you struggle getting the types you want and eventually find a lifesaver blogpost like [TypeScript Types You Should Know About](https://xpbytes.com/articles/types-you-should-know-about-typescript/). This cheatsheet accumulates them.

## Automated JS to TS Conversion

- [TypeWiz](https://github.com/urish/typewiz)
- [js-to-ts-converter](https://github.com/gregjacobs/js-to-ts-converter)
- [TS-migrate](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/ts-migrate-a-tool-for-migrating-to-typescript-at-scale-cd23bfeb5cc) from Airbnb 
- [dts-gen](https://github.com/microsoft/dts-gen) - `dts-gen` is a tool that generates TypeScript definition files (.d.ts) from any JavaScript object.

## Utility Types

Be familiar with the [Utility Types that ship with TS](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html). On top of that, here are handy Utility Types often used by TS practitioners, with explanation on what they do and how they can help. We will assume knowledge of [mapped types and conditional types](https://mariusschulz.com/blog/series/typescript-evolution) like `Exclude<T, U>` and `ReturnType<T>` but try to build progressively upon them.

> Note: If you are new to conditional types, I highly recommend [DJSheldrick's blogpost and talk on Conditional Types in TypeScript](https://artsy.github.io/blog/2018/11/21/conditional-types-in-typescript/)

<details>
  <summary>
    <code>Optionalize&lt;T extends K, K&gt;</code>: Remove from T the keys that are in common with K
  </summary>
  
```ts
/**
 * Remove from T the keys that are in common with K
 */
type Optionalize<T extends K, K> = Omit<T, keyof K>;
```
  
  An example usage is in our HOC section below.

<details>
  <summary>
    <code>Nullable&lt;T&gt;</code> or <code>Maybe&lt;T&gt;</code>: Make a Type into a Maybe Type
  </summary>
  
```ts
/**
 * Make a Type into a Maybe Type
 */
type Nullable<T> = T | null
type Maybe<T> = T | undefined
```

Your choice of `null` or `undefined` depends on your approach toward missing values. Some folks feel strongly one way or the other.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>
    <code>Dictionary&lt;T&gt;</code>: Dictionary of string, value pairs
  </summary>
  
```ts
/**
 * Dictionary of string, value pairs
 */
type Dictionary<T> = { [key: string]: T }
```

`[key: string]` is a very handy trick in general. You can also modify dictionary fields with [Readonly](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-8.html) or make them optional or Omit them, etc.

## Type Testing

- https://github.com/ikatyang/dts-jest
- https://github.com/SamVerschueren/tsd
- https://github.com/azz/jest-runner-tsc
- https://github.com/dsherret/conditional-type-checks
  * `IsNullable<T>` - Checks if `T` is possibly `null` or `undefined`.
  * `IsExact<T, U>` - Checks if `T` exactly matches `U`.
  * `Has<T, U>` - Checks if `T` has `U`.
  * `NotHas<T, U>` - Checks if `T` does not have `U`.
  * `IsAny<T>` - Checks if `T` is the `any` type.
  * `IsNever<T>` - Checks if `T` is the `never` type.
  * `IsUnknown<T>` - Checks if `T` is the `unknown` type.

## TypeScript Plugins

You can write plugins to modify typescript syntax itself. this is ADVANCED and not exactly recommended but here are some examples if you need them:

- https://github.com/rimeto/ts-optchain/

## types to runtime


- https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts Runtime type system for IO decoding/encoding
- https://github.com/nokia/ts-serialize-closures
- https://github.com/YousefED/typescript-json-schema Generate json-schemas from your Typescript sources.

## Misc

- [sourcegraph chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sourcegraph/dgjhfomjieaadpoljlnidmbgkdffpack?hl=en) - hover over types in GitHub and jump to definition/references
- https://github.com/urish/typewiz Automatically discover and add missing types in your TypeScript code

API Extractor provides an integrated, professional-quality solution for all these problems. It is invoked at build time by your toolchain and leverages the TypeScript compiler engine to:

- Detect a project's exported API surface
- Capture the contracts in a concise report designed to facilitate review
- Warn about common mistakes (e.g. missing exports, inconsistent visibility, etc.)
- Generate \*.d.ts rollups with trimming according to release type
- Output API documentation in a portable format that's easy to integrate with your content pipeline

## documentation

- https://github.com/phryneas/remark-typescript-tools

* it transpiles TypeScript code examples to JavaScript
* it typechecks your TypeScript code examples
* it allows you to include Docblocks from your sourcecode

## monorepo build tooling

- https://rushstack.io/ - Specific strategy that integrates popular tools like NodeJS, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Webpack, Jest for large scale monorepos from Microsoft
- https://nx.dev/react/guides/js-and-ts - Nx is a general-purpose build system and a general-purpose CLI. It works with JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C#, Go, etc.. The core plugins Nx comes with do work best with JavaScript or TypeScript.
- https://blog.mgechev.com/2018/11/19/introduction-bazel-typescript-tutorial/ - Bazel is a powerful tool which can keep track of the dependencies between different packages and build targets. For simplicity, we can think of a build target as a build rule - for example, ‚Äúbuild a TypeScript library‚Äù
